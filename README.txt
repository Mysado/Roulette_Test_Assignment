I started with reading about how the game should function (mostly types of bets)
Then i proceeded with planning how should i detect bet placement - i settled for colliders for bets and raycast from chip.
I had to implement touch controlls and that took me a lot of trying of different solutions - i had
few years break from doing an android game and i never implemented drag and drop touch controlls.
Then it was matter of writing few simple controllers to test if my idead of bet placement would work, i tested if everything worked correctly
and then i expanded controllers to support all of the bets with their winning multiplier.
Lastly i finished up with few of the ui elements and more testing.

If given more time i would like to:
 - write some code for automatic bet placement on board
 - implement some kind of chip snaping to a bet (so they wont cover all of the board) 
 - write save/load functionality.
 - implement possibility of buying chips with real money
 - do leaderboards
 - implement visual effect of spinning the roulette
 - maybe add american type board for diversity
 - implement possible higher bets (after certain money threshold chips have increased worth and cost)
 - make more complex ui with particle effects
 - add sound effects
